Anime Recommendation Website
Welcome to the Anime Recommendation Website! This project allows users to browse and discover various anime recommendations, powered by a CSV file containing anime data that is converted into JavaScript objects for dynamic display.

Project Overview
This website provides a clean, user-friendly interface for users to explore anime recommendations. The data is stored in a CSV file, which is processed and converted into JavaScript objects using a Python script. The front-end of the website is built using HTML and CSS for a polished, responsive design.

Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Python 3.x
Node.js (for running JavaScript)
pip (Python package installer)
You will also need to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/anime-recommendation-website.git
cd anime-recommendation-website
Step 2: Set up the Python environment
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check this by running:

bash
Copy code
python --version
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Generate JavaScript Objects from CSV
The CSV file containing the anime data will be processed into JavaScript objects using the Python script generate.py.

Run the following command to generate the animeData.js file:

bash
Copy code
python generate.py
This will read the data from the CSV file, convert it to JavaScript objects, and save it as a .js file that will be used on the front-end.

Usage
Once the dependencies are installed and the animeData.js file has been generated, open index.html in your browser to view the site.

The site will display a list of anime recommendations dynamically loaded from the generated animeData.js.

You can add more anime recommendations by updating the anime_data.csv file and running the generate.py script again to regenerate the JavaScript objects.
